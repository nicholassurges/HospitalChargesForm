# HospitalChargesForm

Visual Basic

Hospital Charges
Create an application that calculates the total cost of a hospital stay. The application
should accept the following input:
The number of days spent in the hospital, as an integer
The amount of medication charges
The amount of surgical charges
The amount of lab fees
The amount of physical rehabilitation charges
The hospital charges $350 per day. The applicationï¿½s form should resemble the one
shown in Figure 6-23.
Create the following functions:
CalcStayCharges Calculates and returns the base charges for the hospital
stay. This is computed as $350 times the number of days
in the hospital.
CalcMiscCharges Calculates and returns the total of the medication,
surgical, lab, and physical rehabilitation charges.
CalcTotalCharges Calculates and returns the total charges.
ValidateInputFields Checks the validity of the input fields by converting each
to a numeric value and checking its range. If any input
field is found to be invalid, this function displays an error
message and returns a value of False.
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative value for length of stay, medication
charges, surgical charges, lab fees, or physical rehabilitation charges. When displaying error messages, use a Label control and specifically name the missing field and the type of data to be entered (integer or numeric).
